We are inside a courtroom.
Mihai is accused of plagiarism.
The lawyer must proove his innocence and asks you for your help (you are a specialist in informations).
So, you take 2 poetries: one of Mihail Eminescu and one of Nichita Stanescu.
You use this 2 texts in order to formulate 2 transition matrices (one for each author), wich is able to capture the probability of transition in between words.
You combine all the matrices in to a log likelihood matrix.
We use the log likelihood matri in order to scan, by using a sliding window, the text of Mihai, wich was accused of plagiarism.
Negative score point out to one models, positive to another, and zero models to neither.
Simulate the text of Mihai (create it with ChatGPT) and ask it to  make it a combination between 2 poetries of Emilescu & Stanescu.
After that, you should be able to tell wich part is written by Eminescu or Tanescu, or by nither (neither means original by our accused Mihai).

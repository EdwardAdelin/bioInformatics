Gel electrophoresis is an analysis method implemented in all disciplines of life sciences. 
The results of gel electrophoresis indicate the relative sizes of fragments, which is useful for restriction mapping and analyzing PCR fragments. 

1. Take an arbitrary DNA sequence from the NCBI (National Center for Biotechnology), 
between 1000 and 3000 nucleotides (letters).

2. Take 10 random samples from this sequence, between 100-3000 bases.

3. Store these samples in an array.

4. Simulate the migration of these DNA segments on the electrophoresis gel, based on their molecular weights - however, their length should be sufficient for this exercise (show a visual representation).

Note: Short DNA fragments meet small friction forces and travel faster through the electrophoresis gel. Long DNA fragments exhibit a high friction force and travel slowly through the electrophoresis gel.

Download 10 influenza virus genomes and apply the electrophoresis gel simulation on each of them.
Make a comparison between the 10 electrophoresis gel simulations and show which of the influenza genomes show
the most DNA sequences. You can plot them in the same graph, but separatelly, because the lines may overlap.
As the main restirction enzimes, please use ECOR1.

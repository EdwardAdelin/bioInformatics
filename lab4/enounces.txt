1. Implement an application that converts the coding region of a gene
into an aminoacid sequence. Use the genetic code table from Moodle.
Take a sequence of DNA and convert it into ARN sequence:

S adn = ... ATG...... TAA ...
S ARN = ... AUG...... UAA ...

2. Download from NCBI the FASTA Files containing the COVID-19 genome, and the influenza genome. Use the AI to compare 
the codon frequencies between the two genoms.

a. make a chart that shows the top 10 most frequent codons for COVID 19
b. make a chart that shows the top 10 most frequent codons for influenza
c. Compare the 2 results and show the most frequent condons above the 2 genoms
d. Show in the output of the console the top 3 aminoacids from each genom
e. Formulate a prompt for the AI such that the 3 aminoacids are used to ask the AI "which foods contain less of those aminoacids"

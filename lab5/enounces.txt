1. Take an arbitrary DNA sequence from NCBI, between 1000 and 3000 nucleotides.
a) Take 2000 random samples from this sequence, of about 100-150  bases
b) Store these samples in an array variable/list
c) Rebuild the original DNA sequence by using these random samples.
d) What will be your main problem with you algorithm? Describe ; namely what kind of strcuture
inside the original sequence may create different computation issues.
Note: the samples must be aligned starting with the minimum of 10 positions in order to avoid random matching.

2. Seach and upload from NCBI or other website 10 viral genomes. Use each of this genomes in order to take samples and 
make a set of samples for each virus.
a) Measure the time in miliseconds of assembly for each set
b) Measure their overall C+G percentage
c) Plot a chart in wich the coordonates of the poits are as follows:
    - on the Y axis, the point will take the time [ms]
    - on the X axis, the point will take overall C+G [%]
d) Make a text file in which you explain the diffs. between the position of the points.

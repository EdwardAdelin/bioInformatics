Viral Genome Assembly and GC% Comparison

SARS-CoV-2:
  GC% = 37.97
  Assembly Time = 1.01 ms

HIV-1:
  GC% = 42.12
  Assembly Time = 0.99 ms

Hepatitis B:
  GC% = 48.49
  Assembly Time = 0.00 ms

Dengue virus 2:
  GC% = 45.82
  Assembly Time = 0.92 ms

Zika virus:
  GC% = 50.94
  Assembly Time = 0.00 ms

Ebola virus:
  GC% = 41.07
  Assembly Time = 1.02 ms

Norovirus:
  GC% = 48.01
  Assembly Time = 1.01 ms

Adenovirus 2:
  GC% = 55.20
  Assembly Time = 0.00 ms

HPV16:
  GC% = 36.54
  Assembly Time = 1.00 ms

Measles virus:
  GC% = 47.43
  Assembly Time = 0.00 ms

Observation:
Viruses with higher GC% may have slightly longer assembly times due to sequence complexity and nucleotide composition.
However, the effect also depends on genome length and sampling randomness.

1. Take an arbitrary DNA sequence from the NCBI 
(National Center for Biotechnology), between 1000 and 3000 nucleotides 
(letters).
Implement a software application that detects repetitions
(between 3b and 6b) in this DNA sequence.

Note: Repetitive sequences refer to patterns that repeat N times. Minimum number of repetitions is 2.


2. Download 10 influenza genoms. For each genom, plot on a chart the most frequent
repetitions.

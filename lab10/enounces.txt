A very early step in splice site recognition is exon definition, 
a process that is as yet poorly understood. 
Communication between the two ends of an exon is thought to be required for this s
tep. Computational discovery of the exon-intron border or the intron-exon border 
or the transcription factor binding sites (TFBS) is a challenging but important 
problem of bioinformatics. Implement a software application for DNA motif finding
 by following the steps below.

Download 10 influenza genomes, adapt your app from the previous 
assignment in order to scan each genome for possible
motifs. For each genome, make a chart that shows the signal with 
most likely locations of real functional motif.
